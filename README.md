# Crop-Yeild-Production-Using-EnSemble-Algoritghm
        Machine learning, is a strategy that gives us preferable outcome based on several weather condition 
    features. The datasets are used to train the models, where the output is bring on by working on the 
    historical data. 
    
        For prediction purpose the dataset need to be divided into two parts (Train and Testdata).
    By this we can say that predicting the crop yield is not an easy job as there are many countries and many 
    types of crops. Crop cuisine varies greatly around the world. The basic ingredients that every crop 
    contains are quite similar. In this project the prediction of top 10 most consumed yields all over the 
    world is established by applying combination of various machine learning techniques.
    
        Machine Learning is now being highly used, In the project, ML methods are applied to predict the 
    crop yield using the data available from Kaggle. The application of five algorithms and comparison of 
    which will render the best results. By calculating the accuracy of the five algorithms, The selection of 
    two Algorithms can be done for ensembling, So that Accuracy for the whole model may increase.

# Conclusion
        Ultimately, we have implemented a system to predict the crop yield from the collection of 
    historical data. This has been settled with the usage of some of the machine learning techniques. Here, 
    “Ensemble of Decision Tree Regressor with AdaBoost Regressor” is used to predict the outcome with 
    an increased accuracy rate. We have grasped that the inclusion of a decision tree will increase the 
    accuracy rate compared to other algorithms. 
    
        The Decision tree alone does not yield much of an accurate outcome stemming from a weak result.
    To boost up the weak learner in the decision tree, the AdaBoost regressor is ensembled. The improvement
    in accuracy will gain more crop yield. This system supports people to decide which crop should be 
    cultivated in the field based on the parameters taken into consideration. 
    
        In this project, we have taken the top 10 crops which solves the majority of 
    consequences when the parameters consist of the location and weather conditions. The accurate 
    prediction of crops across the world will help people to make a clear decision in choosing a suitable crop 
    for yield.
